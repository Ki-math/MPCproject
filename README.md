プロジェクト: MPCproject

This is the ordermade Model Predictive Control library.
All files are packed as the Simulink project.
Please open the MPCproject.prj at first.

In this project, you can see two folders "Examples" and "util".
The Example folder includes some sample folders for indicating how to use this library.
I picked some control objects for evaluating the perforamnce.
For example, Vehicle, Chemical reactor, Semi active damper.

The util folder includes common source files for executing the blocks.
So you need to include this folder into the MATLAB path.

Please enjoy and study about the Model Predictive Control.
